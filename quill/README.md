# Quill

**A writing-first, interactive document environment for OCaml**

Quill blends the simplicity of distraction-free writing with the power of live OCaml code. It’s built for focus—whether you’re working solo or collaborating—reimagining the notebook experience to keep you in the flow.

## Features

- Minimal markdown-based rich text editing with live formatting
- OCaml cells fit naturally into your document, part of the story, not an interruption.
- Inline code execution with persistent session state
- Data visualization integration via Hugin
- Real-time collaboration support *(Coming soon)*
